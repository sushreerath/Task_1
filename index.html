                Rachel Smith’s Lore Olympus webtoon is a modern retelling of the
                ancient Greek myth of Hades and Persephone, which has taken the
                digital comics world by storm. This article explores the complex
                world of “Lore Olympus,” providing details on the Lore Olympus
                characters, major themes, and the impact this beloved series has
                on readers.

                Persephone, the goddess of spring, is the story’s heroine
                alongside the underworld. Initially portrayed as an innocent and
                naive young woman, her character develops dramatically as she
                faces more challenges. Persephone is depicted with pink skin and
                a generous heart, a stark contrast to the harsh reality of
                Olympus. Her journey included discovering her strength and
                dealing with the trauma of being raped by Apollo, as well as her
                strong feelings about the underworld.

                In the Lore Olympus webtoon, Hades, the God of the underworld,
                takes center stage. Often depicted as a handsome blue man in a
                business suit, Hades runs the Underworld Corporation, serves as
                the older brother of Zeus and Poseidon, and plays a role in the
                Six Traitor Dynasty. His character takes on the burden of
                leadership and pursuing personal interests. [Read Lore Olympus

                1. Best Supernatural Manhwa – Leviathan
              </h3>
              <p>
                The protagonist, Bota, and his family live on a small boat
                because the water has risen and captured the dry lands. So, they
                search for food and more from the underwater cities. Leviathan
                follows the survival journey of the siblings Bota and Rita Ma
                following the murder of their father at the hands of a sea
                monster. Following a near-lethal encounter with a monster, Bota
                and Rita are taken in by Kana, an acquaintance of Teon Ma, their
                late father. Eventually, a tragic twist in the narrative, Bota,
                Rita, and Kana find themselves battling for the survival of
                humanity.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">2. Tower of God</h3>
              <p>
                The Tower of God revolves around Twenty-Fifth Baam, who spends
                most of his early life stuck beneath the titular tower. While
                looking for his friend Rachel, he climbs the mysterious tower.
                What he will discover in his quest to find his friend is also
                beyond anything he could have imagined. Moreover, the more he
                climbs, the more difficult it gets, as each floor offers him a
                new obstacle that he has to overcome to keep climbing. Baam
                needs to succeed in all these challenges to reach the peak of
                the Tower eventually.

              <p>
                Existence follows the central character Lee Jan-In, who has
                experienced countless lives as a different species being before
                being born as a human. With each life, he questions the
                objective of his constant reincarnation. After being born as a
                human with all the memories of his previous life, he understands
                the purpose of his existence, and that is the extermination of
                humanity. However, soon after experiencing the intricacies of
                human life, he eventually begins to question the meaning of his
                life.
